# 💰 Loan Default Prediction Dashboard

An intelligent **Machine Learning Dashboard** built with **Streamlit** to predict the probability of loan default based on borrower data such as age, cash inflow, and GPS stability.

This project helps financial institutions and data teams make data-driven decisions by analyzing behavioral and demographic patterns of users.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The **Loan Default Prediction Dashboard** combines real-time analytics and machine learning to evaluate a borrower’s likelihood of defaulting on a loan.  
It uses data such as:
- **User attributes** (age, demographics)
- **Financial data** (cash inflow)
- **Behavioral data** (GPS activity & stability)
- **Loan outcomes** (repaid or defaulted)

The model is trained on historical data and made accessible through an **interactive web dashboard**.
